- Scaffold placeholder screens: 22.

## Sprint Progress

| Sprint | Goal | Status | Commit | Verification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5D | Full app baseline, re-audit, and completion roadmap | Complete | `42e6664` | Build, onboarding parity, data validation, bbox 08/20/21/23/30/32/34/37, smoke real UI flow, interaction smoke | Initial audit showed 37 scaffold placeholders |
| 5E | Workflow action and optimistic command foundation | Complete | Workflow checkpoint commit | Build, data validation, current smoke, workflow smoke 5/5, onboarding parity, current bbox gates | Shared optimistic mutations and event timeline implemented |
| 5F | Promote Today, Inbox, Notifications into audited Real UI | Complete | Pending | Build, data validation, onboarding parity, bbox 08/09/10/11/20/21/23/30/32/34/37, smoke real UI flow, interaction smoke, workflow smoke | Screens 09-11 now have data-parity regions, layout contracts, and bbox scripts |
| 5G | Convert company/goals/projects wave | Complete | Pending | Build, data validation, smoke 19/19, bbox 12-19, parity reference 12-19 | Screens 12-19 now render Real UI components with structural gates |
| 5H | Convert workforce support wave | Complete | Pending | Build, smoke 26/26, bbox 22/24/25/26/27/28/29, parity reference 22/24-29 | Screens 22 and 24-29 now render Real UI components with structural gates |
| 5I-5N | Convert remaining manifest route waves | Planned | Pending | Per-wave route, bbox, smoke, and parity reference gates | Use manifest and PNG evidence per screen |
| 5O-5R | Interaction, data hardening, polish, and final exit | Planned | Pending | Full gate suite | Final decision recorded in exit report |

## Screens Completed

| Screen group | Routes | State |
|---|---|---|
| 01-07 | `/login`, `/register`, onboarding routes | Frozen static parity pass |
| 08,20,21,23,30,32,34,37 | Demo v1 Real UI routes | Structural pass and smoke covered |
| 09-11 | `/today`, `/inbox`, `/notifications` | Real UI structural pass and pixel polish deferred |
| 12-19 | `/company/overview`, `/company/settings`, `/goals`, `/goals/demo-goal`, `/goals/new`, `/projects`, `/projects/demo-project`, `/projects/new` | Real UI structural pass and pixel polish deferred |
| 22,24-29 | `/agents`, `/agents/new`, `/agents/templates`, `/agents/performance`, `/agents/memory`, `/skills`, `/tools/permissions` | Real UI structural pass and pixel polish deferred |

## Remaining Screens

- Work execution support: 31,33,35-36.
- Governance support: 38-41.
- Budget/reports: 42-45.
- Integrations/workspace/admin/help: 46-55.

## Blockers

- No baseline blocker at audit time.
- The completion scope is large enough to require sprint checkpoints; scaffold fallback must remain visible in reports until each wave is converted.

## Next Action

Start Sprint 5I by converting the remaining work execution support routes into audited Real UI route coverage.
